Introduction
Have you ever wanted to create an analog clock with sound? In this post, we will learn how to design and implement an analog clock with sound using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
So, let’s get started!

1. What is an Analog Clock?
An analog clock is a traditional timekeeping device that displays time through the position of hands on a circular dial. It consists of an hour hand, a minute hand, and sometimes a second hand. In this tutorial, we’ll recreate this classic timepiece using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Setting Up the HTML Structure
To start, we’ll create the basic HTML structure for our analog clock.
3. Styling the Analog Clock with CSS
Next, we’ll style our analog clock using CSS. We’ll also import the Google Fonts “Poppins” so that the fonts look nicer.
4. Adding Functionality with JavaScript
Now it’s time to make our analog clock functional using JavaScript. We’ll use JavaScript to update the position of the clock needles based on the current time. To make our analog clock more engaging, we can add sound effects to indicate the ticking of the clock.
5. Testing and Troubleshooting
Make sure the clock needles move correctly and the sound effects play as expected. If you encounter any issues, check your code for errors and also check errors in inspect elements of the browser.

6. Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to create an analog clock with sound using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
